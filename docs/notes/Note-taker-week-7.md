## stand-up check on everyone's week
- Georges: Leaderboard
- Jasper: Activity repository
- Rares: Username feature
- Snehal: Server screen
- Tygo: Timeline in game
- Razvan: Check over merge requests

## Demo showcase
- Otto: Looks nice, pretty good. 

Beware: Only two weeks left.

## Issues in work division
- Otto: Some people do a lot more than others, it's pretty skewed.
They will be sending out automated emails for people that are lagging behind based on their data.
Take away: Plan more. If you're not able to get the merge request in time, ask for help.

## Workflow
- Comment more on Gitlab.
- More testing.

Unsure about server situation, will ask on Town Square.

## Only two more weeks!!!
