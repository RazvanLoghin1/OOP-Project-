Georges set up the user entity, including the post and get mapping for it.
Jasper set up the attribute entity, and added post mapping to
Tygo, making the buttons on the start screen responsive. And made a css file.
Razvan, did the controllers for question type 1, 2 and post question.

# buddy check reminder

Everyone needs to make sure to do the buddy check before this friday.

# goal of next week

Get the single player working for TA meeting. Maybe just questions, no need 
for jokers at this point.

# change of roles for this week

Jasper and Tygo swap since they haven't done frontend or backend yet.
So for frontend: Rares, Razvan, Jasper
backend: Georges, Snehal, Tygo

# response message to Otto

Otto asked us to send a progress report on our work this week and how we were
doing for the demo. This is the message we ended up sending: 

Hey Otto, we just had our meeting for this week. And we're starting to get some stuff working. On the backend getting our entities setup for the demo has been going alright. And for the frontend all the scenes have been setup for the demo, so that is great. We just need to start connecting the front and backend together and actually be able to play a working game :)

# merge request checkup

Jasper, Tygo, Georges, Razvan and Rares managed to have a merge request merged this week.
Snehal didn't end up merging anything.

# additional meeting

We planned another meeting for saturday at 13:00, to check up our process for getting the demo working for the next meeting.

# feedback round

Make sure to merge main into your branch every so often to make sure there are less merge conflicts.
