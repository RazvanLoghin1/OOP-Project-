# stand-up check on everyone's week
- Georges and Tygo worked on the frontend, setup a few scenes for main menu, leaderboard, some question types
- Jasper Razvan and Rares worked on the backend, setup the API endpoint

# discussion on previous/current/future work
- We keep the backend/frontend team system + everyone can start working individually on features (of their respective teams)

# team for next week:
- frontend: Razvan Tygo Rares
- backend: Georges Jasper Snehal

# work for next week:
- post method, start making new entities, make a logcal schema for the entities
- controlers for the fxml files (going from the menu to leaderboard etc) making a css file for all the scenes

# checkstyle discussion
- use the package in the template, setup like 10 rules
- don't use the google java -> will lead to everything being wrong

# feedback for hci report
- main remark: make it more scientifical/use information literacy knowledge, check information literacy rubrik to make it more proper
- expand the introduction
- justify the way the work is being dome, discuss pros and cons
- reformat the issues
- check hci rubrik
- find more links
- content is good

# feedback on gitlab
- everyone should have at least one merge request per week
- work that is not merged is not complete
- code review/comments/have people of the other team to check the merge request

# goal for the week after the midterms
- have the minimal product/demo (singleplayer + multiplayer)

# real talk time
- discrimination, people not being taken seriously
- if someone has some concerns -> reach out to Otto/head TA/staff/academic councelors/independant councelors

# testing
- rest controlers easy to test
- just test what we're able to test, use OOP knowledge

# buddy-check coming up
- **don't miss the deadline**

# tips and tops round
- make smaller merdge requests
- thank you Jasper
- now's the time to start coding for everyone
